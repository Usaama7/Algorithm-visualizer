The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based project designed to help students understand and visualize various sorting algorithms using JavaScript. With this interactive tool, users can observe how algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort work in real-time.

The project offers an intuitive user interface where students can input a list of numbers or generate random data sets. They can then select the sorting algorithm they want to visualize and watch as the algorithm rearranges the elements step by step. Each step is visually represented on the screen, allowing students to see how the algorithm operates and how the data is manipulated at each stage of the sorting process.

Additionally, the Algorithm Visualizer provides explanations and insights into the inner workings of each algorithm, helping students grasp the underlying concepts behind sorting techniques. Through this hands-on approach, students can deepen their understanding of algorithms and gain practical experience in solving sorting problems.

Overall, the Algorithm Visualizer serves as an invaluable educational tool for students learning about algorithms and data structures, offering a dynamic and engaging way to explore and comprehend complex sorting algorithms through visualization and interaction.
